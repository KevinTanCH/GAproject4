GA Project 4 Spring BOOTh

### Personal Notes
I haven't matched all end points for front end yet so back end is waiting for front end to have a fetch function to sent. And Back end needs to refractor.
I just wanted to learn Java and try making a backend server. But the time constraint of 2 weeks was really REALLY tiring. I only knew some C++ before learning Java.
